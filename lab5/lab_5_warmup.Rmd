# Lab 5 Warm-up

## 1. Load the fish data. 
```{r}
fish <- read_csv("data/Gaeta_etal_CLC_data.csv")
```

## 2. Transform the fish data to only include the variables lakeid and length.  Store this as a new dataframe called "fishlength".   
```{r}
fishlength <- select(fish, "lakeid", "length")
```


## 3. Filter the `fish` data to include the samples from lake "BO".  
```{r}
filter(fish, lakeid == "BO")
```


## 4. Calculate the mean length of fish from lake "BO".  
```{r}
bo_fish <- filter(fish, lakeid == "BO")
mean(bo_fish$length)
```
